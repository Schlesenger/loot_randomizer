This is a program meant to help randomize loot drops in d&d 5e
All of the magic items in the list come from either dnd5e.wikidot or ledger.thegriffonssaddlebag.com
Everything has also been relcassified according to the guidelines in Blackball's Treasure to have magic items better sorted by power level
That being said the loot randomizing system pulls from Blackball's for the magic items and the DMG for the rest
In the results you can highlight a line and right click to pull up a new window with the magic items description
